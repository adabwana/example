## Advice/Debugging Requested
I'd like to know how create machine learning pipeline thru three process

1) Fully Clojure workflow with scicloj's default registered models from `fastmath`, `smile`, and `xgboost`. (See `notebooks/scicloj.clj`)
2) Mostly Clojure workflow but tapping into sklearn registered models from Python's `scikit.learn` module. (See `notebooks/sklearn.clj`)
3) More Python reliant workflow with `libpython-clj2`. (See `notebooks/interop.clj` and desired Python code in `PythonElasticNet.txt`)

Thank you in advance.
